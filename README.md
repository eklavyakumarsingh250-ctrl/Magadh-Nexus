🏛️ Magadh Nexus: RWA Logistics Protocol
A Sovereign, Mobile-First Logistics Gateway for Emerging Markets.

🦈 Project Philosophy: The Shark Protocol
Magadh Nexus is a decentralized infrastructure (DePIN) layer designed for the transport corridors of Bihar, India. It tokenizes physical material shipments (Bijari/Kankar) directly into the Creditcoin L1, bypassing traditional "Retail Traps" in supply chain finance.

 🛠️ Technical Resilience (Mobile-Sovereign)
This protocol is engineered to run entirely on ARM64 Android Kernel via Termux. 

**The Triple-Terminal Architecture:**
1. **The Heartbeat:** A localized JSON-RPC server (Hardhat) hosting 20 sovereign accounts.
2. **The Logic:** A Python-driven RWA engine simulating 100% verified shipment cycles.
3. **The Oracle:** A high-fidelity terminal UI tracking real-time fleet movements (BR-01 series).

 📦 Core Logic
- **Verified Ledger:** Every truck movement generates an immutable cryptographic hash.
- **Asset Tokenization:** Physical freight is converted into verifiable on-chain credit events.
- **Offline-First:** Designed to manage enterprise-grade RWA data without cloud dependency.

🌍 Impact
Built in **Dhutauli, Bihar**, this project serves the **Fleet Manager** operating in disconnected infrastructure zones. By providing a lightweight, terminal-based Command Center, we empower local transporters to unlock global liquidity through the Creditcoin network.
